   "We won't be able to raise money for the cathedral after it"

Game Objectives:

- As monotheistic, your god is either the only true god (and all other gods
  are false ones) or all other gods, to you, are just the same god of yours
  (their followers just didn't realized that!). Either way, your religion is
  totalitarian and will aim to be the single one (or recognized by all others
  that all religions are the same). You should:
  - Mainly survive and don't be extinct by other monotheistic religions;
  - Extinct other religions or force them to conceive that they follow the same
    god as yours.

Game Play

- User chooses their 'messiah' and its faith's name.

- Game inits with a single priest and some amount of money in a pre-built
  city, where some terrains are available to buy.
  \  Oponents could be pre-established faiths or newcomers as yours.

- You must buy a terrain and construct your first temple.

- Each 'religious-actor' on the game (you and your opponents) must attract 
  city's population to their cult. The ammount of people following a religion 
  is the main 'on-conflict' resource.

  To attract people you can:
    
    A) Propaganda:
       1) Do some radio / TV / newspaper propaganda for yourself
       2) Do some radio / TV / newspaper propaganda blaming an opponent
       3) Buy some radio or TV space and
         I) Transmit your cults
         II) Transmit a program not explicit religious, but with implicit 
             propaganda
         III) Transmit a doutrinous program.
       4) Buy a radio / TV station or a newspaper - in this case you should
          define the ammount of each above factor on its grade.

    B) Miracles:
       - Act some miracles inside your temple.
       - Act some miracles outside.
       - Blame those false prophets of another Faiths and some 'witch-hunt'.
       Note: too much miracles - or too easy to smoke out ones - could have 
             awfull effects.

    C) School
       - Create schools based on your faith.

    D) Temples
       - Create new temples
       -  Expand your current ones (will cost money, and must need at least
          n followers).

    E) Politic Party
       - Incentive your priests to enter a Politic Party
       - With some power, you can even create or buy a Politic Party to your
         faith.

 - Another key factor to your faith is money. Without it, you'll lose your
   temples. Without temples, there's no followers. Without followers, there's
   no faith.

   What will cost money:
      - Temples and school ordinary expenses;
      - Miracles (it's expensive to be plausible)
      - Buying space on the media
      - Creating new priests
      - Governmental taxes (could be extinct if you are able to pass a law)

   What will make money to you:
      - Tithe, payd by your followers
      - Sell 'saint' items
      - Sell faithfull books and music
      - Part of your politician's salary
      - Sell space on your TV/Radio/Newspaper (beware: it could be bough by 
        your oponents against your faith)
      - Use your politicians in favour of some enterprise for a bribe. (beware:
        if caught and those bribes got public, you'll lose followers).
